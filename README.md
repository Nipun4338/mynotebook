# My Notebook
A small python daily notebook project using openCV haar cascade frontal face detection.
User can register his account by training faces. Each sample generates 100 frames for training. One can only access one's account if training confidence level is much higher. User can create, update, delete notes and can add or view multiple images for separate notes.<br>
Didn't give much effort on it, so I guess it needs future improvement!

## Libraries
